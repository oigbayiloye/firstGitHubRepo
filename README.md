# firstGitHubRepo
Here is my first GitHub Repository.

It's not the first time I am hearing about GitHub, I have an idea of what it is used for or at least I think I do.

But now that I am venturing into other areas of technology, by the way, I have been a traditional network guy all my career up until now, GitHub became one of the requirements for my learning journey.

So, this Repository is the very first I am creating and I am just testing out how versioning and other features works. I may add some other things to the repo as time goes by, maybe this will be a repo for my thoughts, learnings and the likes, I really can't tell what will become of it in the future.

I may not have something special or interesting to offer you in this repo as at today, but I definitely want to thank you for taking out time to check it out!

Smiles!
